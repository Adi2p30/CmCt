  Parameter para. to Dataset. Internal: added config file names.
Jeff Guerber, Original version 2015-07-02

This file is in Emacs org-mode format.  But that's just normal text with
some outlining markup ("*"s, "-"s, and "+"s, mostly) that org-mode
interprets to provide organization, outlining, colorization, visibility,
lists, etc.  Subsections are denoted by increasing numbers of "*"s.  Lists
and sublists are denoted by "-"s or "+"s.  NOTE: TO SEND IN EMAIL,
EXTENSION CANNOT BE .org.  (Apparently .org is also used by some other
program, and Exchange Server checks to see if it really is that program's
format... which this isn't.)


* Purpose of this document
This document specifies the interface between the CMCT web front end and the
computational back end, and documents the format and semantics of the run
configuration file.


* Interface
The web front end will supply the computational back end with a run
configuration file containing the information described in this document.

** File format: currently, JSON.
JSON is proving rather difficult to write, unless perhaps if it's done
automatically by built-in tools.  We may change to a different format like
XML in the future.

** File transfer
The front end will run the script cmct_launch.ksh, supplying the full path
to the run configuration file as its argument.


* Terminology
Since the file will be in JSON format, this is largely based on JSON
terminology:

** Value
A JSON value may be string, number, list, or object.  Strings are
enclosed in "double quotes".  Numbers are not quoted.

** Object
A JSON object is a sequence of key:value pairs, enclosed in {...}, and
separated by commas and optional whitespace: { "a" : "foo", "b" : 5 }
- Keywords are always strings.
- Value may be a string or number, or may itself be a list or object.
- Value is ALWAYS REQUIRED, even if it's null or not used.  Otherwise the
  file won't parse.
- No comma after final key:value pair.
- Comma MUST separate pairs even if they are on separate lines.
- CMCT will expect keys to be in lower case.

** List
A JSON list is a sequence of values, enclosed in [...], and separated by
commas and optional whitespace: [ "bar", 10, 3.15 ].
- Note that value may itself be a list or object.
- No comma after final value.
- Comma MUST separate pairs even if they are on separate lines.
- I might refer to it as an array.

** KEY
This document uses KEY to indicate that the following term is the key in a
JSON key:value pair.

** ISA
This document uses ISA (as in, "A" is a "B") to indicate whether the value
is an object, list, string, number, etc.

** "TODO"
This is a standard org-mode marker indictating a to-do item.

** KEY COMMENTS
The JSON format does not provide a means of including comments in JSON
files(!).  Therefore, I use keys called "COMMENT", "COMMENTS", or
"COMMENTnn" (where nn are digits) to add commentary.
- Comment values may be strings or lists of strings.
- Comment keys may occur anywhere grammatically appropriate in the file.
- CMCT software SHALL NOT make use of COMMENT values.


* Run configuration file specification
There is an example of an actual run-config file later in this document.

** ALL KEYS ARE REQUIRED
Even if they aren't used for the particular combination of other values.
For example, model_time_index is not used if format is cism-text, but must
still be present.  Also, remember that all keys MUST have a value.

** cmct_run_config.json ISA object
- This is standard JSON grammar: all files are objects, therefore they begin
with { and end with }.
- Top-level object will contain one key:value pair, key "cmct_run_config".
- Top-level object may also contain optional COMMENT keys.

*** KEY cmct_run_config ISA object
- This is the only item (other than optional COMMENT keys) in the
  file object.
- Contains a "run" object and a "comparisons" object.

**** KEY run ISA object
- Contains information about this run.

***** KEY runid ISA string
- Unique internal run identifier.
- Assigned by the web site at time of submission.
- Form: userid_dateTtime, eg. "jguerber_20160427T141050"
- Misc notes: Formed from userid + date + time.  I prefer ISO-format
  date/time strings, eg. 2015-07-02T12:34:56, for their sortability; and
  hate unreadably long strings of digits eg. 20150702123456.  The final
  format above is a compromise between readability and compactness.  Unix
  epoch seconds could be acceptable but are harder to correlate with actual
  date/time.  More accuracy than seconds is too long and probably
  unnecessary.  UTC would be better than local time, to avoid potential
  problems with EST-EDT transitions.

***** KEY date ISA string
- Date and time of submission.
- ISO format.
- Set by web site.

***** KEY upload_dir ISA string
- Full path to the directory where the web site has placed the uploaded
  model file(s).
- cmct_launch.ksh will copy them from here to the working directory.

***** KEY user_run_title ISA string
- Title supplied by user, eg. for use on plots.
****** TODO TBD: Maybe this should be for each comparison

***** KEY loginname ISA string
- User's CMCT user ID.

***** KEY actualusername ISA string
- User's real name.

***** KEY email ISA string
- User's email address, to contact when run is complete.


**** KEY comparisons ISA list
- Each item in the comparisons list describes one of possibly several
  model-vs.-observations comparisons.
- Initially supporting only one comparison per submission
- In the future will support more than one comparison

***** list item ISA object
- Each list item contains key:value pairs "model" and "observations"

****** KEY model ISA object
- Information about the model file.

******* KEY modelname ISA string
- Name of the model
- Supplied by user

******* KEY filename ISA string
- Name of the uploaded model file.
- Does not include the path.
- Assumed to be in upload_dir.

******* KEY format ISA string
- Format of the model file.
- Acceptable values:
  + cism-text
  + netcdf

******* KEY spacing_km ISA number
- Model grid spacing, in km.
- Real or integer, interpreted as real
- Supplied by user

******* KEY region ISA string
- Acceptable values:
  + greenland
  + (future) antarctica

******* KEY variable ISA string
- Name of the variable in the model file to compare against observations
- Supplied by user
- OPTIONAL for format=cism-text, the back end software assumes which column
  to use, so this is only for reference
- REQUIRED for format=netcdf, the named variable will be extracted from the
  model file and compared to the observations

******* KEY user_comments ISA string
- Comments and documentation supplied by the user
- Planning to rename to "description"
- Arbitrary string.  It can include new lines which the front end will
  escape appropriately.
- Current CMCT back end software maximum length 1000 characters.  This can
  be changed easily.

******* KEY model_time_index ISA number
- Integer
- For format=netcdf, specifies index along the Time axis.
- For format=cism-text, assumed to be 1.  These files only contain one time
  step.
- Begins at 1, ie. Fortran indexing.
- This is an INDEX, NOT the time value itself, because of the numerous ways
  time is given in the model files.

****** KEY observations ISA object
- Information about the observations which have been selected by the user.

******* KEY mission ISA string
- Name of the mission and instrument
- Acceptable value:
  + icesat-glas
- More will be added in the future, but not near-term.

******* KEY campaign ISA string
- For mission=icesat-glas, ICESat campaign to use
- Possible values (note that these are all uppercase, as is standard
  ICESat Project usage):
  + L1A, L2A, L2B, L2C, L3A, L3B, L3C, L3D, L3E, L3F, L3G, L3H, L3J, L3I,
    L3K, L2D, L2E, L2F
- Not all values may be acceptable for all datasets
- "All" was once considered but is no longer planned

******* KEY dataset ISA string
- Particular dataset from this mission to compare against.

- Acceptable values: This is Jack's original filtered ICESat elevation
  dataset, which he created for comparing CISM models, and is the one we've
  been using up to now:
 + icesat-cism-elev-grn  (elev rel to T/P ellipsoid, Greenland)

- Near future: Jack has created new filtered ICESat elevation files for
  this project, which include multiple elevations.  These will eventually
  replace icesat-cism-elev-grn.  Do not include L1A.  Names are not
  definite yet.
  + icesat-cmct-tpelev-grn    (elev rel to T/P ellipsoid, Greenland)
  + icesat-cmct-wgselev-grn   (elev rel to WGS85 ellipsoid, Greenland)
  + icesat-cmct-egmmtelev-grn (elev rel to EGM08 mean-tide geoid, Greenland)
  + icesat-cmct-egmtfelev-grn (elev rel to EGM08 tide-free geoid, Greenland)

- Datasets for other missions are TBD.


* Example
This is an example of a complete run config file as described above.  Line
breaks, indentation, and unquoted whitespace are not significant in the
JSON format.
