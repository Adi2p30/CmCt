The Cryosphere model Comparison tool (CmCt) is a data analysis tool to facilitate ice sheet model comparison, validation, and analysis. Currently, the CmCt is used to compare ice sheet models provided by the user with remotely sensed laser (ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)), radar (ERS-1, ERS-2 (European Remote-Sensing Satellite), and Envisat (Environmental Satellite)) altimetry and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravimetry data. The CmCt works for both Greenland and Antarctica.
